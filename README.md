# vst3-list
A simple utility to list the vst3 (and vst) plugins inside the main folder. Just to keep everything organized.

The only things that you have to do are: 
- give the main folder path, where all the plugins are stored (or press enter to select the default one); 
- give the path where you want to save outputs (.csv files) (or press enter to select the default one).

The utility will list all the sub-folders of the companies and it will create a .csv file containing all your VSTs, grouped depending on the sub-folders.
- If some plugins are listed as _Unknown, it means that these plugins are not inside a sub-folder, and you should create it (or move the plugin inside one of the existings) to keep everything organized.
- If some plugins are listed as _Unrecognized, then these can be extra files or just trash.

BTW, _Unknown and _Unrecognized groups are listed in VST3_2Check.csv, all the remaining (organized) plugins are listed inside VST3_List.csv

If you appreciate it, please let me know something, or consider to support my work.
